### Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fortunefinances.git
    cd fortunefinances
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    AUTH0_SECRET=your_auth0_secret_here
    AUTH0_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
    AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://your-auth0-domain.us.auth0.com
    AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_auth0_client_id_here
    AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your_auth0_client_secret_here
    ```
    *Note*: The Firebase configuration, including the API key, is currently hardcoded in `firebase-config.js` for simplicity, but for production, it is recommended to manage these securely as environment variables.

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Usage
