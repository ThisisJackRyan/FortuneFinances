### What is Fortune Finances?

Fortune Finances is a web application designed to provide users with short, wise financial advice, similar to a fortune cookie, powered by artificial intelligence. Users can interact with a virtual fortune cookie to receive personalized financial insights, and their past fortunes are saved for future reference.

### Getting Started

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>

    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    AUTH0_SECRET=your_auth0_secret

    AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your_auth0_client_secret
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
